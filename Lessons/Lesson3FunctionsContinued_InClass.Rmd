# Functions Continued

Today in class we will continue our discussion about building and using functions. We will look back to the example from the end of class on Wednesday to demonstrate the use of iterative function calling with `for()` loops, `apply()` family functions, and `map()` family functions from the `purrr` package. We will also discuss the idea of functional modularization while creating functions that do complex tasks. 

## Applying functions systematically

The following example demonstrates code that would be better served by constructing a function to accomplish the task.

```{r example_change_to_functions}

### I want to take the following olive oil data and standarize the columns
# install.packages("pdfCluster")
library(pdfCluster)
data(oliveoil)
# ? oliveoil
names(oliveoil)
head(oliveoil)

#----------------------------------------------------------------
### Start with a dataframe where I create the z-scores for palmitic acid, then add the rest 
oo_standardized <- data.frame(
  palmitic = (oliveoil[,"palmitic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"palmitic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"palmitic"]),
  palmitoleic = (oliveoil[,"palmitoleic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"palmitoleic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"palmitoleic"]),
  stearic = (oliveoil[,"stearic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"stearic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"stearic"]),
  oleic = (oliveoil[,"oleic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"oleic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"oleic"]),
  linoleic = (oliveoil[,"linoleic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"linoleic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"linoleic"]),
  linolenic = (oliveoil[,"linolenic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"linolenic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"linolenic"]),
  arachidic = (oliveoil[,"arachidic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"arachidic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"arachidic"]),
  eicosenoic = (oliveoil[,"eicosenoic"]-mean(oliveoil[,"eicosenoic"]))/sd(oliveoil[,"eicosenoic"])
)
head(oo_standardized)

### Could I do this better with a function? Yes (and No)

# function specific to oliveoil data frame
oo_stand <- function(varname){
  (oliveoil[,varname]-mean(oliveoil[,varname]))/sd(oliveoil[,varname])
}
oo_stand("palmitic")[1:10]

# building the standardized data almost as repetative as previous approach
oo_standardized2 <- data.frame(
  palmitic =  oo_stand("palmitic"),
  palmitoleic =  oo_stand("palmitoleic"),
  stearic =  oo_stand("stearic"),
  oleic =  oo_stand("oleic"),
  linoleic =  oo_stand("linoleic"),
  linolenic =  oo_stand("linolenic"),
  arachidic =  oo_stand("arachidic"),
  eicosenoic =  oo_stand("eicosenoic")
)
head(oo_standardized2)


#----------------------------------------------------------------
### Could do this iteratively with for-loops
acids <- names(oliveoil[3:10])

for (acid_name in acids){
  print(oo_stand(acid_name)[1:5])
}

#initialization storage space for transformed values
oo_standardized3 <- as.data.frame(matrix( rep(NA,nrow(oliveoil)*8), 
                            nrow=nrow(oliveoil) ))
names(oo_standardized3) <- names(oliveoil)[3:10]
# loop over the acid names
for (acid_name in acids){
  oo_standardized3[,acid_name] <- oo_stand(acid_name)
}
# check the outcome
head(oo_standardized3)

#----------------------------------------------------------------
### Could also do this with APPLY type statements
# apply() used to apply functions over the indeces of an array 
# lapply() used to apply functions over the values in a list, outputs to a list
# sapply() used to apply functions over the values in a list, outputs to a simplified array 
# vapply() used to apply functions over the values in a list, outputs to sepecified object type
# mapply() used to apply functions over the corresponding values in multiple lists

# Karsten's Personal Use (with orders of magnitude >):
# sapply > lapply >> mapply >> vapply >> apply

better_oo <- as.data.frame(sapply(acids, oo_stand))
head(better_oo)

better_oo_list <- lapply(acids, oo_stand)

#----------------------------------------------------------------
### Could also do this with map functions from purrr package
library(purrr)
# http://purrr.tidyverse.org 
# help(package="purrr")
# ?map

oo_repetative <- map(acids, oo_stand)
str(oo_repetative)

```

Which is most efficient
```{r timing, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
timer <- Sys.time()
for(i in 1:1000){
  mymod <- lm(palmitic ~ . , data=oliveoil)
}
Sys.time() - timer

# timer <- Sys.time()
# example <- lapply(1:1000, function(x) {
#    lm(palmitic ~ . , data=oliveoil)
# })
# Sys.time() - timer

```


## Applying functions over multiple sets of parameters

In some cases we may wish to apply a complex function by putting in multiple sets of arguements and collecting the results. In the example below we explore a simple case where we want to gather simulated values from a beta distribution with several different shape parameter ($\alpha$,$\beta$) pairs. 

```{r multiple_param_beta}
### Let's check what the rbeta function does first in the help menu
# ?rbeta
# We find that can simulate n observations from a specific beta distribution
rbeta(5,shape1=1,shape2=1)

## I want to apply the rbeta() function over all 100 unique combinations
# of shape1 = {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}
# and shape2 = {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}

# I could create two nested for loops to iterate over these pairs and store as it loops, but that is messy
param_combinations <- expand.grid(shape1=seq(0.5,5,by=.5),
                                  shape2=seq(0.5,5,by=.5))
str(param_combinations)
set.seed(12345)
my_beta_sims <- mapply(rbeta, 
       shape1=param_combinations$shape1,
       shape2=param_combinations$shape2,
       MoreArgs=list(n=5),
       SIMPLIFY = "array")
# rows in parameter storage correspond to the columns in the simulation array
param_combinations[1:10,]
my_beta_sims[,1:10]

# Could turn this into an 3-dimensional array where the index
# [i,j,k] represent the [i-th simulation, j-th shape1, k-th shape2] 
dim(my_beta_sims) <- c(5,10,10)
my_beta_sims[ , , 1]


### Now suppose I want the mean for the simulation outcomes array
mean(my_beta_sims[ ,1 , 1])

beta_means <- apply(X = my_beta_sims,
      MARGIN = c(2,3),
      FUN=mean)
str(beta_means)

### We could now check our simulated means against a theoretical mean
theoretical_beta_mean <- function(alpha, beta){
  alpha / (alpha + beta)
}

#*# Your turn: create a 10X10 matrix of the theoretical means for the beta distribution using the function above





```


## Writing Modular Functions

When you are writing functions to do a complex task, try to identify the system of simple tasks that are needed to accomplish it step-by-step. For example we might consider building functions to help us to automate the process of running stepwise selection based on AIC, then outputting a model object that we can use for prediction, or inference. 

We might initially think of one big function that can take a model matrix, X, and does a bunch of linear algebra to get beta estimates, calculates an AIC for the fitted model, then removes a columns from X to reduce the model... and repeat... a lot. Is that what we find inside the `step()` function?

```{r step_select_function}
### Check the body expression of the step function 
# Note: I have commented out the next line of code to keep the html tidy, uncomment to check it out
# body(step)
```

It isn't doing any of the linear algebra and AIC calculations I expected! The body of the step function is filled with, well more fuctions! It is function pinata!

![(silly pinata animation)](https://media.giphy.com/media/103lPvxq3k01l6/giphy.gif)

What we find is that the `step()` function calls many other functions to do the individual smaller tasks that make up the complex procedure. If we search closely, there is a function for dropping a row, `drop1()`, within a `while` loop that keeps dropping rows until a condition is met. There is a function for updating the fit of the model, `update()`, and calculating the AIC, `extractAIC()`. There is even a function created at the start of the body that are used to help organize and return a helpful print statement about the stepwise procedure: `step.results()`. 

These functions are often times called "helper functions", completing the sub-tasks of the primary function. This modular format allows each function to complete a single simple task, and when used in combination, achieve a complex task.
